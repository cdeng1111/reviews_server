# Ratings and Reviews API

This scalable microservice acts as a backend system to support the full data set for product ratings and reviews.

Data was stored in a Postgres database. Data stored consisted of Reviews, Review Photos, and Reviews of specific product Characteristics.

The server was built using Node.js/Express.js, and primarily serves the following three endpoints: Getting product-specific reviews, getting metadata for product-specific reviews, and posting a new product review.
